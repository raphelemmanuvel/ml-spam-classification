# sms_spam_detection-k-means_clustering
A Machine Learning project using Python libraries to cluster a data set of 'sms' messages into 'spam' and 'ham' using k-means clustering.

The dataset is a collection of 5,574 SMS meesages taken from UCI Machine Learning repository need to be tagged as "spam" and "ham".

The whole pipeline conists of the following steps:
1--> Loading data
2--> Data wrangling and pre-processing
3--> Feature Selection
4--> Feature Matrix Modelling
5--> k-means clustering and evaluation
6--> Saving results to a csv file

Although there are multiple methods for solving the problem, tfidf approach is employed here to obtain high prediction accuracy.
